This project is basically an assembler thatconverts the assembly programs written in hack assembly language into hack machine language.
This project is composed of two cpp files.
In the first file named "hack assembler without symbols.cpp" only simple assembly programs (in which no symbol or label is used) are converted into machine code.
The second file named "hack assem with symbols.cpp" works for both without symbols and with symbols assembly programs.
